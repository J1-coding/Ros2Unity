# Unity-ROS1-Pick-and-Place-Tutorial

This repository contains the implementation of a **Pick and Place Tutorial** using Unity's Robotics Hub and ROS1 Noetic. The project demonstrates how to set up a TCP connection between ROS and Unity to manipulate a robotic arm in a simulated environment.

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on tutorial on how to integrate ROS with Unity for robotic manipulation tasks. This project can serve as a learning resource for robotics enthusiasts and researchers interested in learning more about ROS-Unity integration.

The project uses Docker for ROS to create an isolated and consistent environment for running ROS1 Noetic, hence minimizing the setup and compatibility issues. It allows the Unity environment to communicate with ROS via TCP connection, enabling the manipulation of a robot arm in Unity.

A video demonstration of the project is also provided, which shows a cmd window describing the ROS process and a Unity editor window illustrating the robot arm manipulation. This visual aid is beneficial for anyone who wants to understand the project's workflow and outcomes.

Key components and technologies used:
- Unity
- ROS1 Noetic
- Docker for ROS
- TCP for ROS-Unity communication
